# First Sounds

A simple phonemic spinner game for kids.

## Running

Serve the project from a local web server rather than opening `index.html` directly. One easy option is the built-in Python server:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Other servers work as well, such as Node's `npx serve`.

The app relies on audio files in the `audio` folder and image files in the `images` folder. Make sure these assets are present.
