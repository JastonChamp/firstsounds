# First Sounds

A simple phonemic spinner game for kids.

## Running

Open `index.html` in your web browser to start playing. A web server is no longer required because the word list is bundled directly into the script.
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Other servers work as well, such as Node's `npx serve`.

The app relies on audio files in the `audio` folder and image files in the `images` folder. Make sure these assets are present.
